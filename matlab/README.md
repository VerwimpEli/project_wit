## Project WIT: Matlab

## Main script
The `main.m` script will solve the main assingment. Most significant options that 
maybe want to be changed are `VW` and `VH` which denote the gridsize in the width and heigth.
Also `maxiter` can be adapted to change the number of optimization iterations.

The main script will plot two figures. Figure 1 will have the final solution and figure 2 will
have the inital temperature and the optimized temperature.
